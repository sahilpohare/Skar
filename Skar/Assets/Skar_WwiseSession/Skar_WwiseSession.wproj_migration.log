Warning: Effects on Auxiliary Busses will no longer ignore dry levels. Effects that used to ignore dry levels had their dry levels muted by the migration if they were placed on Auxiliary Busses to keep the project's previous behavior. There may be differences in behavior if the same Effect is applied to an Auxiliary Bus and another object. Please refer to the migration notes for more information.

Some new object properties have been added or obsolete properties deleted. The project file was updated. These changes will not have an impact on your project.
Properties related to Platform(s) "'3DS, PS3, PS4, VitaHW, VitaSW, Wii, WiiUSW, WindowsPhone, Xbox360, XboxOne'" were detected and removed from project as they were unreferenced. This could happen if you migrated a project from a previous version where some platforms were disabled. Disabled platforms are unavailable as they are being replaced by custom platforms. If you wanted to keep information relative to disabled platforms, enable them before performing migration.
